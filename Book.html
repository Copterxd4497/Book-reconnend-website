        <section id="fiction">
            <h2>1. Fiction</h2>
            <div id="fiction_detail">
                <p>A fiction book is a literary work where the content is created from the author's imagination rather than based on factual events or real-life people. Here are some key details:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Invented Characters and Events: Fiction books feature characters, plots, and settings that are products of the author's creativity. These elements are not real but are crafted to tell a story.</li>
                    <li>Genres and Subgenres: Fiction encompasses various genres, such as mystery, romance, science fiction, fantasy, horror, and thriller, each with its own conventions and storytelling styles.</li>
                    <li>Narrative Techniques: Fiction often employs various narrative techniques, such as first-person or third-person perspectives, unreliable narrators, and stream-of-consciousness writing to enhance the storytelling experience.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

        <section id="non-fiction">
            <h2>2. Non-Fiction</h2>
            <div id="non-fiction_detail">
                <p>Non-fiction books are works of writing that are based on real events, people, and facts. They are grounded in reality and provide information, insights, and explanations about various subjects. The primary purpose of non-fiction books is to inform, educate, and sometimes persuade readers, rather than to entertain through imaginative storytelling.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Biographies and Autobiographies: These books tell the life stories of real people, either written by someone else (biography) or by the person themselves (autobiography).</li>
                    <li>Memoirs: Similar to autobiographies, memoirs focus on specific aspects or periods of the author's life rather than covering their entire life span.</li>
                    <li>History: These books provide detailed accounts and analysis of past events, helping readers understand the context and impact of these events.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

        <section id="graphic-novels">
            <h2>3. Graphic Novels and Comics</h2>
            <p>Graphic novels are a type of book that combines both text and illustrations to tell a story. They are similar to comic books but are usually longer and cover a complete narrative arc, much like traditional novels. Graphic novels can encompass various genres, including fiction, non-fiction, fantasy, science fiction, memoir, and more.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Illustrations: Graphic novels rely heavily on visual storytelling. The illustrations are essential to the narrative and work alongside the text to convey the story, emotions, and actions.</li>
                    <li>Sequential Art: Like comic books, graphic novels use sequential art to guide the reader through the story. This means that the images are arranged in a specific order to create a coherent narrative.</li>
                    <li>Panels: The artwork in graphic novels is typically divided into panels. Each panel represents a segment of the story, similar to a frame in a film.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>4. Poetry</h2>
            <p>Poetry books are collections of poems, which are literary works that express emotions, ideas, and stories through the use of distinctive styles and rhythms.

                <ul>
                    <li>Verses and Stanzas: Poems are typically composed of lines grouped into verses or stanzas. Each stanza can vary in length and pattern, contributing to the poem's overall structure and rhythm.</li>
                    <li>Rhythm and Meter: Many poems follow a specific rhythm and meter, which refers to the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables. This gives the poem a musical quality and helps emphasize certain words or themes.</li>
                    <li>Rhyme: Poems often use rhyme schemes, where the end sounds of certain lines correspond with one another. Rhyme can create a sense of cohesion and beauty in the poem.</li>
                </ul>
